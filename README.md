# EspoCRM Lua CRUD SDK

EspoCRM is a single page application so the frontend uses REST API to connect with the backend. All operations you perform using the UI, you can implement via API calls using your programming language. You can learn how the API works if you trace what's going in the network tab in your browser console (press F12 key to open the console).
